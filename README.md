## Requirements

[Figma Placeholder]

As shown in the above figure, a two-column layout Data Portal needs to be implemented.

The data for this Data Portal will be obtained through a WebSocket connection, which will provide a real-time, dynamically updated stream of price data with time as the dimension.

The left side will display a dynamically updated line chart, with the vertical axis representing prices and the horizontal axis representing time. This repository provides the echarts-for-react library as a chart rendering tool. However, you can also choose other chart rendering libraries according to your preference.
